📊 Academic Stress Analysis in Students (MySQL Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing academic stress-related factors in students using MySQL. The dataset captures various stress indicators such as peer pressure, academic environment, coping strategies, and stress index rates across different academic stages (High School, Undergraduate, Post-Graduate).

The goal of this project is to gain insights into academic stress contributors, patterns, and their impact on student well-being.

🗂 Dataset Details

The dataset includes the following columns:

Timestamp – Data collection time

Your_Academic_Stage – Student’s education stage (High School, Undergraduate, Post-Graduate)

Peer_Pressure – Peer influence factor

Academic_Pressure_at_Home – Stress due to family expectations

Study_Environment – Quality of learning environment

Coping_Strategy – Approaches students adopt to handle stress

Smoking_or_Drinking_on_Daily_Basis – Lifestyle choices under stress

Academic_Competition_in_Student_Life_Rate – Competition level (rated)

Academic_Stress_Index_Rate – Overall stress index rating

🔧 SQL Techniques & Concepts Used

This project demonstrates strong SQL expertise through:

Aggregate Functions → SUM, AVG, COUNT for stress factor analysis

CASE Statements → Categorizing stress levels and coping patterns

Grouping & Windows Functions → Ranking and partitioning data for deeper insights

WHERE & HAVING Clauses → Filtering stress contributors across student groups

Stored Procedures → Automating stress analysis queries

📈 Key Insights Derived

Stress distribution differs significantly across academic stages.

Peer & academic pressure at home are key drivers of student stress.

Students adopt varied coping strategies, some resorting to smoking/drinking.

Academic competition strongly correlates with higher stress index rates.
